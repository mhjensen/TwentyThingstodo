# Twenty and more  things to do, by Morten Hjorth-Jensen, Department of Physics and Center for Computing in Science Education, Unversity of Oslo

Hope for the best and prepare for the worst is one of the motivations
behind this document. More importantly, the present COVID-19 situation
has the potential to unleash a lot of creativity where we explore the
best from the digital world and the best from the classical socratic
classroom environment. In particular, developing flipped classrooms
with small groups which meet with teachers and work on assigned
problems and projects, has the potential to improve the way we
teach. And is a possible solution to an eventual hybrid solution with
small groups of students due to social distancing.


The overarching motivation is to ensure an equal access and right to
 higher educations, irrespective of background and physical situation.
 A serious problem is how to welcome new students and ensure that
 they can develop their own social and professional networks. A fully
 online first semester either for freshmen or new graduate students
 needs to account for this in the best possible way. A hybrid solution
 would make things much easier.




## Initiatives to improve online education

- Collaborations between USIT, CCSE, LINK and many more units
- Search for funding initiatives on digital learning platforms and environments
- IT postdocs. These are postdocs hired at different departments with a 50% education commitment towards digital learning and platformss and 50 % own research. Can be coordinated by CCSE.

## Some key issues that need to be resolved in online course delivery

- Ensuring all students have a laptop and appropriate internet access so that online delivery works for them. Also, we may consider asking students to have either a laptop with touch screen and/or a tablet that can be used as whiteboards
- Equip teachers with tablets or laptops with touch screens to be used as whiteboards.
- Developing or adapting curricula and learning objectives that are meaningful in online settings.  This is particularly acute for laboratories, field work etc
- Developing and delivering authentic and validated assessment and exam systems for the online environment
- Enhancing peer to peer interactions and group work in online settings
- Innovative technology for education, and particularly online education
- Using evidence-based practice and engaging education researchers in continuous improvement of the online experience.  What are the ways in which online education is actually better than in person?
- Develop TA and LA pedagogical program that addresses a digital learning environment
- Recruit LAs from 1st and 2nd year students (students that enlisted in 2018 and 2019)
- Aid in making digital learning material, from videos and notes and exercises/projects. Professional support for media groups at UiO


## Ensuring a hybrid solution, _flipped classrooms as solutions_

- Develop approach to flipped classrooms by making digital learning material of high quality, videos and lecture notes
- Students are expected to have read the material before they come to group meetings. Quizzes and questions about material part of final grade.
- Groups of at most ten students meet teachers and LAs amd TAs and discuss material and work on assignments (weekly exercises and projects)
- Larger component of project based work in order to also help students to socialize and build own networks
- Establish committee immdediately which plans for hybrid solutions and explores space boundary and initial conditions. How many rooms do we have at our disposal for this? As an example, FYS-ST4155 had fall 2019 150 students. This specific course would need 15 groups with two hours each, that is two full days in a room with a capacity of ten students and two teachers, assuming with social distancing. 
- The teaching rooms should also have large monitors that allow students who cannot attend (or do not want to) physically to participate in the group sessions
- Extend teaching hours from 8am to 8pm, with _no economic compensation for faculty_


##  Ensure student engagement from day one, fully online and/or hybrid solution
- Engage students with career training and research projects at an earlier stage in their education
- Provide to a larger extent summer jobs with teaching and research elements
- Develop small student groups with tight connection and integration with faculty, possibly mentor program from day one
- Develop ideas to engange virtuall with exisiting students, faculty and alumni. Develop a virtual UiO community
- Training students in how to become engaged digital citizens living in a rich and rewarding online environment
